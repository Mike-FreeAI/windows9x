Supporting a simulation of the windows registry would be big for letting AI generated applications interact with other ai generated applications.
It would also be a great first step for giving generated applications the ability to interact with the operating system itself.

The registry is essentially a key value store for the windows operating system. For the purpose of this project it can be flat.
The key can be any string and the value is a json serializable object.

These are the major components we need to support the registry inside of windows9X:

1. We need to add a new file called state/registry
2. This should export an atom that we can use to read and write to the registry and is stored to local storage
3. In the Iframe component inside of WindowBody.tsx we need to expose the registry atom to the iframe. This involves listening to "message" events from the iframe and forwarding them to the registry atom.
4. In program/route.ts we need to update the prompt to specify that a registry api is available.
5. We need to inject the registry api into the iframe. We can use the injectIntoHead option for stream html to inject the api into the iframe.
6. The iframe api that is exposed to the generated programs should look like this:

```typescript
interface RegistryApi {
  get: (key: string) => any;
  set: (key: string, value: any) => void;
  delete: (key: string) => void;
  listKeys: () => string[];
}

declare global {
  interface Window {
    registry: RegistryApi;
  }
}
```

New windows9X experiment: reading and writing to the registry. This is the gate way to letting AI generated applications interact with the operating system and each other. For example, ai generated programs to change your desktop background!
